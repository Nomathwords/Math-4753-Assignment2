# Questions

## Q1  

### a) Given a pair of matched prints, what is the probability that an expert will fail to identify the match?

Given a pair of matched prints, the probability that an expert will fail to identify a match is 7.88%.    

### b) Given a pair of matched prints, what is the probability that a novice will fail to identify the match?  

Given a pair of matched prints, the probability that a novice will fail to identify a match is 25.45%.  

### c) Assume the study included 10 participants, 5 experts and 5 novices. Suppose that a pair of matched prints are presented to a randomly selected study participant and the participant fails to identify the match. Is the participant more likely to be an expert or a novice?  

Though the odds of the study participant being an expert or a novice are $\frac{1}{2}$, if the randomly selected study participant fails to identify the match, they are likely, but not guaranteed, to be a novice, because a novice has less of a probability to identify a pair of matched prints than an expert.

## Q2

### a)  Given the athlete is a user, find the probability that a drug test for testosterone will yield a positive result.

$P(Positive | User) = \frac{50}{100} => 50%$  

### b)  Given the athlete is a nonuser, find the probability that a drug test for testosterone will yield a negative result.

$P(Negative | Nonuser) = \frac{891}{900} => 99%$  

### c) If an athlete tests positive for testosterone, use Bayesâ€™ Rule to find the probability that the athlete is really doping.

$\frac{P(User \cap Positive)}{P(Positive)} = \frac{50}{59} => 84.70%$  

## Q3  

### a) Prove Theorem 3.1 in your own words  

Assume we have $k$ sets of elements, $n_1$ through $n_k$, with k items in each set. We want to form a random sample by taking $m$ elements from each of the k sets. If each pull consists of $i$ steps, the first step can be performed in $s_1$ ways, the second step can be performed in $s_2$ ways, and so on. The $ith$ step is performed in $s_i$ ways. We can generalize the whole procedure to $s_1 * s_2 *...* s_i$ ways we can pull an element from a set, until we get $m$ elements.  

## Q4  

### a) Prove Theorem 3.2 in your own words  

Assume we have a set of $N$ distinctly different elements, and we want to select $n$ elements from $N$ and arrange them in $n$ positions in a certain order. We take our first element $N_1$ and put it in the first position, leaving us with $N - 1$ choices for our second element. We then take $n_2$, leaving us with $n-2$ choices. We keep going and get the formula $N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * (N - n + 1)$, by the multiplicative rule we proved above. This formula equals $\frac{N!}{(N \space n)!}$, giving us the correct formula for the Permutations Rule.

## Q5  

### a) Prove Theorem 3.3 in your own words  

Let $A$ be the number of partitions we can make out of a set of $N$ elements into $k$ sets. We know from Theorem 3.2 that $P_N^N = \frac{N!}{(N-N)!}$ We can rewrite this equality from Theorem 3.1: $P_N^N = A * n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!$, where $n_1!$ is the number of ways we can arrange the $n_1$ elements in position 1, $n_2$ is the number of ways we can arrange the $n_2$ elements in position 2, and so on. This can be rearranged to $A = \frac{N!}{n_1!n_2! ... n_k!}$, giving us the formula for the different number of partitions of $N$ elements in $k$ sets.

## Q6  

### Prove Theorem 3.4 in your own words

We can use Theorem 3.3 as the base for Theorem 3.4. When a sample of elements is selected from a set, we are partitioning these elements into $k = 2$ groups. The first group is the set $n$ that was selected from the sample. The second group is the remaining $N - n$ set that has yet to be selected. By applying Theorem 3.3, we get the following formula: ${\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}} = {N \choose n}$ 

## Q7

### a) Verify that the probabilities for $Y$ in the table sum to 1  

$p(0) = .09$, $p(1) = .30$, $p(2) = .37$, $p(3) = .20$, and $p(4) = .04$. Adding these up, $09 + .30 + .37 + .20 + .04 = 1$

### b) Find the probability that three of four of the homes in the sample have a dust mite level that exceeds $2 \frac{\mu g}{g}$

$P(3 \cup 4) = .24$  

### c) Find the probability that fewer than two homes in the sample have a dust mite level that exceeds $2 \frac{\mu g}{g}$  

$P(Y \leq 1) = .39$
